SMS Spam Detection Project

This project focuses on SMS spam detection using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which comprises 5,574 messages labeled as either ham (legitimate) or spam. The primary objective is to develop an effective spam classifier.

About the Dataset

The SMS Spam Collection dataset consists of English SMS messages, providing a diverse set for spam research. The dataset includes 5,574 labeled messages, with tags indicating whether each message is legitimate (ham) or spam.

Algorithm Selection

Various classification algorithms were explored, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and others. After thorough evaluation, the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm demonstrated superior performance.

Results

The Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved outstanding results on the dataset:

Accuracy: 98%
Precision: 100%
This high precision and accuracy make MNB the optimal choice for effectively identifying and classifying spam messages in this project.
